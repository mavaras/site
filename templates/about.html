    I'm <strong style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 700;">Mario Varas</strong>, a Spanish software engineer.
    <p style="margin-bottom: 140;">
    Within software, I have interests in a variety of topics like distributed systems, IT security, cloud development and Artificial Intelligence.<br>
    On the latter, I've academically/professionally worked about hand gesture recognition systems, Machine Learning & cybersecurity and deep image files compression methods.

    <p style="margin-bottom: 140;"></p>
    Being a software enthusiast, the main thing I enjoy is to <strong>contribute</strong> in taking projects from conception to production and beyond, giving dedication and love to the whole process, and having a user-centered mindset throughout the entire process.

    <p style="margin-bottom: 140;"></p>
    In my leisure time, I especially enjoy exercising, cooking and watching basketball üèÄ
