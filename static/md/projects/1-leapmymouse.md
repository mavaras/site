**LEAP MyMouse** is a Windows desktop app that allows you to control your computer by hand gestures. In the back, it has a **real-time gesture recognition system** based on the Leap Motion controller. It can recognize air drawn gestures/strokes, simple and complex ones. Simple ones are short finger or hand moves, not representing any form or defined complex pattern. Secondly, complex gestures are those whose trajectory defines some form or stroke, concretely letters or numbers. Drawing in the air letters like Z, T or V is considered a complex gesture, and something like a finger snap is considered as a simple gesture. In short, you can control your mouse and interact with applications such as PowerPoint.
