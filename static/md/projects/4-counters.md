# counters
---

**counters** is a Python code stats monitoring tool that provides both calling counter and flow chain for/between functions. It allows you to see and control what are your 'heat'/more concurrent functions as well as know what the function call chain is in all or part of your code. You can use counters with sync, async or mixed function call chains.
